## üéØ Purpose & Scope

`devAV` is a comprehensive toolkit for crafting a machine learning-based malware detector. It covers all aspects of application development: from data mining and feature extraction, to model selection and prototype deployment. Although a functional prototype, `devAV` is not intended to replace professional antivirus software.

## üß† Model Descriptions

`devAV` leverages various techniques to classify files as malware or benign. Here's a brief overview of the utilized models:

- **Functions**: Uses imported functions for classification.
- **Strings**: Employs a BERT model to extract features from strings for classification.
- **Mnemonics**: Classifies based on the frequency of mnemonics per instruction type groups.
- **Entropy**: Uses the entropy of sections within a binary file for characterization and classification.
- **Generic**: Performs classification based on basic characteristics of PE and ELF files.

To ensure the most reliable outcome, `devAV` applies a **Voting System** for final decision-making. This involves utilizing the results from the aforementioned models, each casting a "vote" on the file's classification. The majority vote decides the final outcome.

## üìä Data & Results

Our testing involved a dataset of 21,090 files, comprising 10,739 malware and 10,351 benignware files. The ensuing performance metrics were impressive:

|   Metric   | Functions | Entropy | Strings | Generic | Mnemonics | Voting |
|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|:------:|
|  Accuracy  |   0.925   |  0.961  |  0.955  |  0.770  |   0.783   |  0.966 |
| Precision  |   0.881   |  0.949  |  0.977  |  0.713  |   0.557   |  0.951 |
|   Recall   |   0.986   |  0.976  |  0.934  |  0.917  |   0.667   |  0.985 |
|  F1 Score  |   0.931   |  0.963  |  0.955  |  0.803  |   0.607   |  0.968 |

The above statistics underscore the potential and effectiveness of machine learning in cybersecurity.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository recursively to include the submodule:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sg1o/devAV.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and install the project:

```shell
cd devAV
pip install -e .
```

Ensure that the required submodule is properly set up:

```shell
pip install -e binsniff/requirements.txt
```

Decompress the models available under `devav/models/compressed-files` using a 7z decompressor.

## üíª Usage

Once installed, you can use the `devav` command to scan files:

```shell
devav --help
```

## üìù Documentation

Additional documentation is available in the `docs` folder. Generate a live HTML version using:

```shell
make livehtml
```
